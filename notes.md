set up well, git init, added all the files
added input and output on readme (could be a table to make it simpler)
commited on file setup

readme tests - not sure needed

use of response - would say thats more to do with checking http responses, maybe use 'result'?

first test good - stated with simplest pass
2nd/3rd test are more edge cases and should come after simple 1 letter words

good debugging on nil - searched and quickly found null

test for 'a' doing more work thats needed for just a to pass
